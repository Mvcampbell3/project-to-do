# project-to-do

This project was simply for me to create an actual to-do-list that I would use often. I made a couple of different to-do list applications before, and was not quite happy with the layout. I really wanted to be able to target different projects and group their tasks separately. This latest version accomplishes that goal. The CSS is 90 percent Bootstrap, of which I am not a huge fan, but this appilcation doesn't require a lot of fanfare and pagentry. It works using local storage to store an overall project object. You can save new projects, remove projects, and add and remove tasks very effienctly.
